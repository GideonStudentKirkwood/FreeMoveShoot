# FreeMoveShoot

This is a side scrolling shooter game I made after my class .NET 1, so it is no longer up to my standards but it was a fun project to put together.

The default Controls are the classic a,s,d,w but there is a in app way to switch controls to the arrow keys.
arrow keys are sometimes a bad choice because of a thing they do in some keyboards where some keys share a connection in they keyboard which results in some button combo's not working such as my left and up arrow key don't work together.

the space button shoots, so move and shoot and please enjoy this small game.
